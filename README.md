Plan for my project would be to design a trip planning tool. The tool will ask for user input about where they would like to go, what days they plan to travel, and what kind of activities they want to do on the trip. The tool will then output a plan for the user.
The onset of the project will be to just make sure the user has properly signed in and the password is authenticated. After this the user is asked to fill out a questionnaire about their travel hopes.
Once this is given, the user will be directed toward their personal dashboard. This dashboard will allow user to update travel plans and in real time it will refresh the data on screen. This data is for an accurate weather forecast for that location around the time of their trip. 

Eventually this page will also give:
* A “Packing Checklist” for this location… adjusting the packing list according to what type of activities they would like to do and the weather. 
* Links to local events during thier stay.
* Links to housing such as a hotel or an AirBnb
* A "Budget Planner" to help find housing, events and food within the budget.
